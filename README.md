# Hover Overlay Animation Cards

I created a set of hover overlay animation cards using **HTML** and **CSS**. These cards have a sleek, interactive design that enhances user experience with smooth transitions and visual effects when hovering over each card.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The cards are fully responsive and adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes.
- **Smooth Hover Animation**: On hover, the overlay slides in with a subtle animation, revealing additional information or actions.
- **Customizable Effects**: The hover effects, colors, and content can be easily customized to fit different themes and designs.
- **Clean and Minimalistic**: The cards maintain a modern, clean look with simple layouts and clear typography.

## How It Works

- **HTML Structure**: The basic structure of each card is a simple container with an image, title, and hidden overlay content that becomes visible on hover.
- **CSS Animations**: The hover effects are powered by CSS transitions and keyframe animations. The overlay content slides or fades in smoothly when the user hovers over the card.
